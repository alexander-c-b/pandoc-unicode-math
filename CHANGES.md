# Release 1.1.0

2019-04-09

A second filter `pandoc-unicode-math-from-latex` was added that replaces
"regular" Latex math commands by equivalent Unicode symbols. This is more or
less the inverse of the existing filter `pandoc-unicode-math`. Idea by Anish
Mittal.

Several new symbols were added. Partly contributed by Eric Hanson.
